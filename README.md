## Git/GitHub Exercise

1. **Prerequisites:**
    * [Register](https://github.com/join) for a GitHub account (if you not already have one)
    * [Install Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/set-up-git) (NOT GitHub Desktop) on your computer
    * Set up Git to connect to GitHub:
        * [Using HTTPS](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-a-repository-using-https) (easier, but you have to enter your username and password every time you push changes)
        * [Using SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories#cloning-a-repository-using-ssh) (more complicated, but you only have to set it up once)
    * Configure Git to use your [name](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/setting-your-username-in-git) and [email address](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/how-tos/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address#setting-your-email-address-for-every-repository-on-your-computer)

2. **Task: Git and GitHub workflow (basic)**
    * [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) this repository
    * [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) your newly forked repository to your computer
    * ([Create](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) a new branch, _optional_)
    * Find an unaltered text file [`data/birth-dates/`](./data/birth-dates), i.e. one which still has some missing information (`????` instead of a year)
    * Look up the birth date on Wikipedia and replace the `????` with the correct year
    * Commit and push your changes to your fork:
        * `git add`
        * `git commit`
        * `git push`
    * [Send us a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) on GitHub (and check back in a couple of days to see if there has been any activities associated with it)
    * ðŸŽ‰ Done! You have gotten your first pull request accepted! ðŸŽ‰

See the exercise materials for more information. You can now return to ILIAS and continue with the other tasks. If you want to go a bit further there is a more advanced but _optional_ exercise as well.

3. **Task: Git and GitHub workflow (advanced, _optional_)**
    * Fork PalMA from https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/PalMA
    * Clone your newly forked repository to your computer
    * Check that you have configured username and email in Git
    * Create a new branch
        * a) Add a new language in directory `locale` (copy directory of English version and paste it to a new directory).
        * b) Edit an existing language in the directory `locale`
    * Translate some texts and adjust the header
    * commit and **sign off** your changes, than push them to your fork
    * Send us a pull request on GitHub
    * ðŸŽ‰ Done! You will be immortalized in the changelog if you complete this part with a substantial contribution! ðŸŽ‰
